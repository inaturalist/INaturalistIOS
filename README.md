INaturalistIOS
==============

INaturalistIOS is the official iOS app for submitting data to [iNaturalist.org](http://www.inaturalist.org).

Setup
-----

We use cocoapods for dependencies. Install it with: `gem install cocoapods`, then do `pod install` in this directory to install the INaturalistIOS dependencies. If you run into the build error *Class 'RK_FIX_CATEGORY_BUGSNDictionary_RKAdditions' defined without specifying a base class*, then you will need to set the clang warning **Unintentional Root Class** to be something other than **Yes (Error)** for the RestKit target in the Pods project. We are moving away from RestKit in 2019 so hopefully this won't be an issue for long.

You'll also need to copy `config.h.example` to `config.h` and fill in your details.

That should get you set up for local development with the Simulator. If you want to test on actual devices you'll need to get a provisioning profile from Apple and configure the project to use it: https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action.

Translations
------------

We do our translations on Crowdin. Head over to https://crowdin.com/project/inaturalistios and create an account, and you can start suggesting translations there. Our team regularly exports translations from crowdin and imports them to this project.
